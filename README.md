# AI-Training-Game
Python based game with Neural Net interfaces for AI implementations.

This repo contains two packages of Python 3.8.3 code.
The first, named 'game' contains the logic for the fighting game which the ai uses to train.
The second, named 'ai' contains the neural network logic which powers the ai in game. The main library used for the AI development is TensorFlow, and is kept up to date with the most recent changes to the software.

The goal of this project is to create a working ai that can play fighting games,
as well as teach others how Neural Networks function.
