# AI-Training-Game
Python based game with Neural Net interfaces for AI implementations.

##Features
As of the time of this commit, the project is based on pyglet, a games library for python. This has been chosen to reduce CPU load when training the Neural Network that comes with the game. The two main parts of this game are as follows:

Game:
A simple fighting style game based on pyglet that is modeled to be easily playable and trainable for an AI.

Neural Network AI:
A TensorFlow based model that trains based on a single user's inputs. The model has been designed to train quickly, and with as few iterrations as possible. Thus making this a single player game with an AI that learns as the user does.
